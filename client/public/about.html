            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Moome was founded by a passionate couple dedicated to supporting local farms, homesteads, and makers. After rescuing our boy Moose, later nicknamed Moo-Me, we started one of our first homestead projects â€” feeding him raw food.</p>
            
            <p>At the time, we lived in an apartment and longed for a simpler life, out on some land. A few years later, we found ourselves raising 60+ meat chickens a year while collecting thousands of eggs from our layers.</p>
        
            <p>We wanted a marketplace where we could offer our 100% pasture-raised products to our local community, while supporting others making and growing amazing food. And that is why we started Moome.</p>
